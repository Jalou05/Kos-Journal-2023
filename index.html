            <h2 class="Dad-waiting">Dad waits patientally!</h2>
            <p>Dad fullfills his leading role as a father and makes sure that the train will stop when it arrives at the Leun Lahnbahnhof. The train was scared of his masculin attitude and luckily stopped.</p>

            <p>The flight as the landing were not that delightful :/ Though the sunrise was pretty and we got safely to Kos :D</p>

            <h2>Breakfast Lunch Dinner</h2>
            <p>At some days it felt like we were just eating the whole day. Our favorite place was "outside right". We didn't only enjoy the food, we also enjoyed the view and of course the company.</p>

            <h2>Kos City (Sightseeing)</h2>
            <p>We got to Kos City and back to the hotel with the bus. Gladly the bus was late, otherwise wouldn't have gotten it. Kos City was pretty, Dad has taken a lot of pictures/ T-shirts ^^, Janni fooled around with a film simulator, Sahri and Mom went shopping and Phili also enjoyed it. </p>

            <h2>A lot of pools!</h2>
            <p>The hotel itself had a beautiful scenery. Probably mom was the one, who was the most amazed by it. Though that doesn't mean the others didn't secretly enjoyed it ;)</p>

            <h2>On our Way Home</h2>
            <p>Our way home was exhausting though everything went by smoothly. Janni watched fightclub, Phili read his comics, Sahri scrolled approximately thousand times through her gallery, dad made sure that everything works out and mom spread her good mood. Janni was very happy about the mces :D </p>
